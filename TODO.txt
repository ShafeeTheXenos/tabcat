Tasks:
- add final interpretation to tasks (intensitiesAtReversal)

Issues:
- "encounter" CouchDB view is empty

Refactors/Fixes:
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- use $ to identify jQuery objects
- always return a valid config
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module
- don't pass messages around via URL
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework
- make separate create_encounter.html page
- makefile should properly handle dependencies

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad

Features:
- demo mode for tasks
- Android fullscreen mode
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- Back button in standalone mode
