v0.4.0:
- hand-test on iPad
- application cache gets stuck on Android



Tasks:
- DART (cleanup)
  - trim blackness at beginning and end of video, handle with JS instead.
  - margins at top and bottom of video are mysterious; is it not square?
    - no, it's 512x480
  - videos don't auto-play on Android (probably need to use canplay event)
  - videos are too tall on android (even when played independently)
  - make video files smaller?

- CouchDB:
  - handle interpretations through lists
    - e.g. /tabcat-data/_design/dart/_list/interpret/core/task?include_docs=true&startkey=["dart"]&endkey=["dart",[]]

Cleanup:
- don't use relative paths in code
- Android fullscreen mode (window.scrollTo(0, 1))
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- compress spilled data
- some strategy for not running out of localStorage
- store UI messages in sessionStorage, not fragment

Nice to Have:
- support for re-opening tasks where we left off
- demo mode for tasks
- Back button in standalone mode
- use lz-string (http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html)
  to compress spilled data
- tabcat.db.gotNetworkError()
  - if we got status 0, statusText "error" from a putDoc request,
    set localStorage.dbNetworkError
  - clear on successful putDoc
  - may flap between offline and "wrong network"

Refactors/Fixes:
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module

Tests:
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad
- iOS Safari and chrome do not save login, password (actually submit form,
  target iframe?)
