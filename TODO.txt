Tasks:
- DART (cleanup)
  - trim blackness at beginning and end of video, handle with JS instead.
  - margins at top and bottom of video are mysterious; is it not square?
    - no, it's 512x480
  - videos don't auto-play on Android (probably need to use canplay event)
  - make video files smaller?

- CouchDB:
  - handle interpretations through lists
    - e.g. /tabcat-data/_design/dart/_list/interpret/core/task?include_docs=true&startkey=["dart"]&endkey=["dart",[]]

Cleanup:
- don't need tasks to be launchable
- fix favicon
- task.start() should require user and encounter ID

Offline Mode:
- offline manifest
  - http://appcachefacts.info/ has good info
  - add a nonce/version number to manifest so it gets reloaded
  - /tabcat-data/config must not 404; this will kill the manifest
    - use kanso upload/curl to create it
  - just have to assume that we need the same paths from /tabcat-data
    as we need from /tabcat
- simple local storage of docs
  - don't use pouchDB; our goal is to only store docs until we can
    dump them to the server
  - possibly compress with https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/blob/master/libs/lz-string-1.3.0.js

- support for re-opening tasks where we left off
- demo mode for tasks
- Android fullscreen mode (window.scrollTo(0, 1))
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- Back button in standalone mode

Refactors/Fixes:
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad
  - currently manually expiring login cookies
- iOS Safari and chrome do not save login, password (actually submit form,
  target iframe?)

Features for later:
- offline mode
