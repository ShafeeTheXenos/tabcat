Tasks:
- DART:
  - handle video network errors
  - get krankin's feedback

Cleanup:
- don't need tasks to be launchable
- fix favicon

Offline Mode:
- offline manifest
- simple local storage of docs
  - possibly compress with https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/blob/master/libs/lz-string-1.3.0.js

Data dump:
- CSV dump of line length tasks, grouped by PIDN, date
- general data dump list




- support for re-opening tasks where we left off
- demo mode for tasks
- Android fullscreen mode
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- Back button in standalone mode

Refactors/Fixes:
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad
  - currently manually expiring login cookies
- iOS Safari and chrome do not save login, password (actually submit form,
  target iframe?)

Features for later:
- offline mode
