Tasks:
- DART (cleanup)
  - trim blackness at beginning and end of video, handle with JS instead.
  - margins at top and bottom of video are mysterious; is it not square?
    - no, it's 512x480
  - videos don't auto-play on Android (probably need to use canplay event)
  - videos are too tall on android (even when played independently)
  - make video files smaller?

- CouchDB:
  - handle interpretations through lists
    - e.g. /tabcat-data/_design/dart/_list/interpret/core/task?include_docs=true&startkey=["dart"]&endkey=["dart",[]]

Cleanup:
- don't need tasks to be launchable
- fix favicon
- task.start() should require user and encounter ID
- require user before attempting to continue encounter
- gracefully recover from unparseable data in localStorage
- don't use relative paths in code

Offline Mode:
- status bar should show offline info
  - show whether online or offline
  - show status of manifest
  - show status of locally stored docs
- remove retrying of data uploading on task finish

Security/authentication:
- auto-uploading of offline docs should respect validate_doc_update
- tag task and event docs with user too
- make separate page and tabcat.ui function for re-entering password

- support for re-opening tasks where we left off
- demo mode for tasks
- Android fullscreen mode (window.scrollTo(0, 1))
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- Back button in standalone mode

Refactors/Fixes:
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad
  - currently manually expiring login cookies
- iOS Safari and chrome do not save login, password (actually submit form,
  target iframe?)
