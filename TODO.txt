Before feature freeze:
- create config document

Features:
- check off tasks that are already completed

Tasks:
- DART

Refactors/Fixes:
- use on() rather than bind() in tasks, attach new div before binding events
- always return a valid config
- break out staircasing code into TabCAT module
- automated JavaScript testing framework
- automated Selenium testing framework
- make separate create-encounter.html page
- makefile should properly handle dependencies

Puzzling issues to revisit:
- Log Out does not clear cookies in standalone browsing mode on iPad
  - currently manually expiring login cookies
- browsers do not save login, password (actually submit form, target iframe?)

Features:
- demo mode for tasks
- Android fullscreen mode
- fix max height of inner div in inches, when possible, using something like:
  https://github.com/tombigel/detect-zoom
- Back button in standalone mode
